Globally, cardiovascular disease (CVDs) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for more than 70% of all fatalities. Technologies such as electrocardiograms and CT scans, critical for diagnosing coronary heart disease, are sometimes too costly and impractical for consumers. Heart disease, specifically cardiovascular disease (CVDs), is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, accounting for over 70% of all global deaths. Many factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and abnormal pulse rate, need to be considered when predicting heart disease. Often, the medical data available need to be completed, affecting the results in predicting heart disease.
Machine learning plays a crucial role in the medical field. Using machine learning, we can diagnose, detect, and predict various diseases. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of developing certain diseases. “Machine Learning is a way of Manipulating and extraction of implicit, previously unknown/known and potential useful information about data”. Machine Learning is a very vast and diverse field and its scope and implementation is increasing day by day.
Machine learning Incorporates various classifiers of Supervised, Unsupervised and Ensemble Learning which are used to predict and Find the Accuracy of the given dataset.
